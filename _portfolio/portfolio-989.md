## About this project
This project is supported by IUK under Smart Shipping Acceleration Fund (10132557) in partner with the NJORD OFFSHORE LTD.

EcoRoutePlanner introduces advanced digital tools for smart route planning and operational efficiency aimed at crew transfer vessels (CTVs) servicing offshore wind-farms, which aims to reduce fuel consumption, CO2 and NOx emissions during vessel operations, improve turbine maintenance, and overall operational efficiency.
Currently, the offshore wind industry faces significant challenges in optimising the operational logistics of CTVs. Traditional approaches to route planning often rely on static scheduling and manual route planning, which cannot adequately consider for the dynamic and ever-changing nature of marine environments. This potentially will lead to inefficiencies such as increased fuel consumption, higher emissions, and extended idle times due to weather and sea conditions, ultimately resulting in elevated operational costs, emissions and environmental impact.
The main innovation of EcoRoutePlanner thus lies in its approach to the artificial intelligence (AI) discipline of multi-objective optimisation, where the advanced algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing ant colony optimisation and other potential approaches will be investigated to find the best solutions for optimising not just finding the shortest route, but also prioritising tasks based on route optimisation, fault severity, expected maintenance duration, and the most energy-efficient idle strategies.
Unlike conventional methods, the proposed solution will dynamically adjust routes according to the measurements of real-time onboard sensor sources, including weather and sea conditions, ensuring both safety and efficiency.
Another innovative aspect is to develop a functional analytics control panel. This tool will provide real-time monitoring of fuel use, emissions, and maintenance progress, allowing operators to make on-the-fly adjustments to forecast potential disruptions and enable pre-emptive operational decisions. 
Additionally, the tool monitors speed with throttle control, which regulates the engine’s power output by controlling the fuel-air mixture entering the engine. This optimisation helps to save fuel and further reduce emissions, enhancing overall operational efficiency.
EcoRoutePlanner’s team is formed by experts in marine operations with over a decade of experience working and managing at Njord Offshore, a leading crew transfer vessel operator in Europe, as well as seasoned researchers in electronics, embedded systems, and algorithm design from the University of Essex. This scalable and portable solution aims to set new benchmarks for smart shipping practices, significantly contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and advancing the UK's leadership in clean marine technology. By addressing the current inefficiencies and leveraging cutting-edge optimisation algorithms, our project promises a transformative impact on the operational efficiency of CTVs servicing offshore wind-farms.
