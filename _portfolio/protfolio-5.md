**Automated Aneurysm Segmentation on Reconfigurable SoC**
The project aims to implement a real-time automated segmentation technique for cerebral aneurysm on the Zynq SoC to create an virtualised interactive environment for doctor training purposes.

**Lattice Boltzmann on Zynq SoC for Blood Flow Measurements**
The project involves the application and implementation of Lattice Boltzmann (LB) fluid dynamics algorithm, which could provide hemodynamic estimation of blood flow used in a training environment to train the surgeons to rehearse and precisely place the clip near aneurysm.
